You will write a small compiler that will read an input program and represents it in an internal data structure. The data structure will contain representation of instructions to be executed as well as a part that represents the memory of the program (space for variables). Then your compiler will execute the data structure (interpret it). This means that the program will traverse the data structure and at every node it visits, it will execute the node by changing appropriate memory locations and deciding what is the next instruction to execute (program counter). The output of your compiler is the output that the input program should produce. These steps are illustrated in the following figure:
